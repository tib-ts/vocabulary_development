However, in modern semiconductor manufacturing, the term has become more of a marketing label than a precise physical measurement. Today, process node names (e.g., 5 nm, 3 nm) represent a generation of technology rather than an exact dimension. They often imply improvements in: transistor density (more transistors per unit area), performance (higher speed, lower power consumption), power efficiency (better energy per operation).\n\n",

I think the key here is the distinction between cycle time and overall production lead time.\n\nCycle time usually refers to the effective processing time of a wafer lot as it moves through all required unit operations in the fab. For a CMOS process, this is often reported as ~10–15 weeks.\n\nHowever, the lead time experienced by customers can be much longer (sometimes >26 weeks), because it includes queueing, waiting for equipment availability, rework loops, engineering holds, and sometimes supply-related delays.\n\nSo while the process cycle time is on the order of 10–15 weeks, the total time from release to delivery can easily extend to six months or more.",

A key distinction, I think, is that lead times are variable and a function of utilization, whereas cycle times refer to the physical processing.",
