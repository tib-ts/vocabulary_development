Communities of data providers and consumers have a common interest in defining and using such standards. The kinds of standards will vary considerably. Some are community based, whilst others require international agreements involving a more formal approach for how they are developed and maintained.  W3C aims to support lightweight community based standards that can be incubated within W3C Community Groups, and if appropriate, transferred to Working Groups where a formal standards track process is desired, e.g. for core standards where a greater level of scrutiny is needed.";

    dcterms:description "A type of non-volatile memory medium invented in 1987 by Fujio Masuoka (then a Toshiba employee). Compared to the NOR type flash memory, NAND flash is smaller in circuit scale, less costly, and offers larger capacities as well as faster read/write speeds. NAND flash is widely used for USB drives, memory cards for digital cameras, and storage devices for mobile phones and digital music players. As conventional chip scaling technology is reaching its limits, 3D structures have been introduced in flash memory devices in recent years. Chips can be split in Memory (DRAM and NAND) and Logic (all others).";
