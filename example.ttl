Communities of data providers and consumers have a common interest in defining and using such standards. The kinds of standards will vary considerably. Some are community based, whilst others require international agreements involving a more formal approach for how they are developed and maintained.  W3C aims to support lightweight community based standards that can be incubated within W3C Community Groups, and if appropriate, transferred to Working Groups where a formal standards track process is desired, e.g. for core standards where a greater level of scrutiny is needed.";

    dcterms:description "In inter-firm supply chains where levels correspond to different companies, demand forecasting can amplify order variability. The reason is that each firm observes demand and independently adds buffers. For example, suppose a retailer sees a small spike in demand. To make sure the order quantity covers both anticipated demand and safety stock, the retailer places an order that shows a slightly larger spike than the one in demand. The distributor then makes a forecast on the basis of retailer orders. Again, since stock must cover both anticipated demand and safety stock, the distributor places an order that represents an even larger spike than that in the retailer order. So, the manufacturer sees an amplified spike in demand. The reverse happens when the retailer sees a dip in demand, which causes the manufacturer to see an amplified dip. The result is that demand volatility increases as we progress up the supply chain.";

    dcterms:description "In a perfect world, customers order what they actually want to buy. However, in the real world, where orders may not be filled, there is incentive for customers to play games with their orders. For example, suppose that when a product is in short supply, the supplier allocates it to customers in proportion to the quantities they have on order. If customers know this, then they have an incentive to exaggerate their orders to increase their share of the rationed product. When the shortage disappears, customers cancel the excess orders, and the supplier is stuck with them. Since this behavior tends to increase orders when actual demand is high (because that is when shortages occur), but not when actual demand is low, the result is an amplification in the swings in demand.";
